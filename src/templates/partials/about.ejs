    Iâ€™m Erik, a passionate frontend developer. Besides writing quality code I'm particularly interested in optimising applications for performance as much as possible. To accomplish this I like to work with either Vanilla Javascript or Vue / NuxtJS.

  <p class="page-paragraph">
    In my own time I like to work on my robotics projects, 3D designing and printing, hardware hacking with Pi's and Arduinos, woodworking and playing guitar.
