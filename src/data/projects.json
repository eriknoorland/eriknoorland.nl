We used the same approach as we did for the Staq page with the JSON files containing the base64 encoded images. Together with the Draggable API from GSAP I could make the model interactive so the user could spin it around by swiping the model. For the desktop version we even went a step further by adding interactive hotspots.",

The technolgy I wanted to get starting on was ES6. Check out the source code on Github.",

I went to the nearest Ikea and bought a Dioder LED strip. It worked and it looked really nice! Except for one thing. The LED controller. A couple of horrible white boxes that you had to have in sight to be able to control your LED strip. That's when I thought I could control this LED strip with a Raspberry Pi so I could create a web-app and control the LED's from any web browser (in my local network).",

We chose to export all frames as separate images, put those images in a bunch of JSON files as data urI's (so we could load one full sequence at a time) and use CreateJS to toggle the bitmaps on and off the stage. It felt like working with Flash / AS3 all over again. To optimize loading of the assets we optimized the images between the endpoints of each sequence to get the megabytes down from 60+ megabytes to around 10 megabytes.",
