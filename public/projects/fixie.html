  The inspiration to do this came from a shopping window downtown where some artist displayed a couple of old racing bikes turned into pimped fixed gear / single speed bikes. After a bit of research i found out there was this whole fixie community where everybody built their own custom bike from either an old bike or from scratch. I was sold immediately and went online to find a bike to start with.
